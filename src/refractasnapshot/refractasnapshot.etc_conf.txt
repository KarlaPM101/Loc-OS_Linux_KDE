# Some laptops overheat when running rsync or mksquashfs. If limit_cpu
# is "yes", cpu activity will be limited on those two commands.
# limit is percentage of cpu allowed for command, up to 100% per core.

# You can change the location of $work_dir (location of system copy) and
# $snapshot_dir (location of final iso file) in case you don't have enough
# space on the system. (Defaults are "/home/work" and "/home/snapshot")
#
# Hints:
#   Be sure to use separate directories for these two variables. If you
# use the same location for both (e.g. /media/disk) and if $save_work
# is set to "no", your CD image will get deleted when the program
# finishes. Instead, use something like /media/disk/snapshot and
# /media/disk/work, or even /media/disk/snapshot/work.
#   These directories will be created by the script, and they are
# already set to be excluded from the rsync copy of the system (so you
# don't end up with an extra copy of your system or old snapshots in the
# final CD image.)
#   Any filesystems mounted in /mnt or /media will be excluded from the
# system copy. Filesystems mounted elsewhere will be included and will
# increase the size of the final CD image. To avoid that, you can either
# unmount those filesystems before running refractasnapshot, or you can
# add them to the excludes file. (See snapshot_excludes below.)

# Custom boot menu and help files section.

# If you're running refractasnapshot on some linux distribution other
# than Refracta, You might also want to edit or remove some of the help
# files in the isolinux directory. (f1.txt, f2.txt...)
# If you want those changes to persist between runs, you should create
# a custom iso/isolinux directory, and set iso_dir (below) to point
# to that directory.



# If the primary user's name is not "user", then live-boot needs to see
# the user's name in the boot command. In that case, the script will
# automatically add the correct option. If you set a user name here, it
# will override that process. Use this if you want to log into the live
# media as someone other than the primary user (i.e. any user whose
# uid:gid are not 1000:1000.)
# Under most circumstances, leave this blank or commented out.

#username=""


# Change to "yes" if you want to be able to view or edit the boot menu
# or any other config files before the final image is made.
# Note2: For SolusOS and possibly others, boot entries should contain
# "union=unionfs" in place of "union=aufs".
# Note3: For anything later than jessie, union=aufs should be removed
# or possibly replaced with union=overlay

# Prepare the initrd to support encrypted volumes. Uncomment this

# Uncomment to include your network configuration in the snapshot.
# This will preserve your /etc/network/interfaces and any saved wireless

# It will also add "ip=frommedia" to the boot command, so that the saved
# configuration will be used.
# Default is commented; interfaces file in $work_dir/myfs gets replaced
# and only contains the loopback interface.
#
# NOTE!!! If you're using some other network manager, and you don't want

# DEPRECATED:
# This patch is no longer needed. Instead, the script will create some
# files in /dev to help with booting. If you leave this variable set
# to "yes" the script will check for previous application of the patch
# and give you the chance to edit the file manually. If you don't remove
# the lines that were added by the patch, nothing bad will happen.
#
#
# Debian Jessie systems without systemd and with util-linux-2.25 will
# create an unbootable iso. The workaround is to add a few lines to
# /usr/share/initramfs-tools/init and then rebuild the initrd.
# If this option is set to "yes" then the script will check for systemd
# and for the version of util-linux. If needed, the script will apply
# the patch and rebuild the initrd.
#
# Warning: If you also need to run the nocrypt.sh script because you're
# creating a snapshot from a system INSTALLED ON AN ENCRYPTED PARTITION,
# you need to run nocrypt.sh after letting this patch run. (Hint: you
# can abort the snapshot run at the Disk Space Report, run nocrypt,
# then make your snapshot.)
#
# Default is "no" or commented out.
